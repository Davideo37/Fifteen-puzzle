Project Requirements:
* Create a functional 15 piece slide-puzzle using javascript + css with an html template.

This project was an immense challenge at first, as I was originally bewildered by how anything was supposed to work without the ability to modify the HTML.
It took a lot of trial/error and googling to find ways of accessing the grid divs through DOM methods and even more beyond to get the syntax properly formatted.
I agonized for a while alongside fellow student Amos Cha in trying to figure out how to approach this project. We later came to the conclusion that we were overthinking this
and I created a much simpler implementation (with some assistance from fellow student Josiah Kangas) and successfully recreated the entire (now functional) project in a few hours.
In hindsight, this project would have been much easier for me and Amos both if we had not tried to take a fully Object Oriented approach.
